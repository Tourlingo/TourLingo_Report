This project is a Multilingual Virtual Tour Assistant web app that helps tourists explore cities more easily. Made with Al Fateh Technologies, it gives real-time translation of pages and directions, AI-made cultural tips, and an easy-to-use map of important tourist spots. It uses OpenStreetMap for navigation, LibreTranslate for translations, and AI for cultural advice. The app works on both mobile and desktop, and can be expanded with more languages and faster premium APIs in the future.
The backend is deployed on a server for reliable performance and easy updates. We tested the system for speed and ease of use with real users, including two testathons where participants tried the app in different languages. Built by eight MSc Computer Science students using agile methods, it has a simple, responsive design and solves problems with language support and relevant cultural content, making local information easier to understand for travellers everywhere.
