This project describes the creation of a Multilingual Virtual Tour Assistant Web Application to help tourists explore unfamiliar cities more easily. Built with support from our client, Al Fateh Technologies, the app offers real-time translation of place names and directions, local cultural tips, and a user-friendly map showing useful tourist locations.
The system brings together open tools like OpenStreetMap for navigation, LibreTranslate for translations, and AI for generating cultural advice. The web app works on both mobile and desktop devices and is designed to be easily expanded to support more languages and locations in the future.
A team of eight MSc Computer Science students developed the project using agile methods. We focused on building an easy-to-use, responsive interface and solving challenges around multilingual support and relevant cultural content. The final product improves travel experiences by making local information more accessible to people from different backgrounds.
