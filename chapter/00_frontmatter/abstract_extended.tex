This report explains the design and development of MSc students' summer term project - Tourlingo, a Multilingual Virtual Tour Assistant web application created in collaboration with Al Fateh Technologies. The webapp Tourlingo is developed to help tourists travel unfamiliar cities with confidence by using real-time translation, information about the local culture, and a customised navigation.

The key features include an interactive OpenStreetMap-based map highlighting major points of interest, and AI-powered cultural tips translated in the user’s chosen language through LibreTranslate. The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

The system was developed by a team of eight Computer Science students using agile practices. Throughout the project, the main challenges were integrating multilingual content, creating an intuitive interface, and ensuring consistent performance across different devices. These were tackled through iterative prototyping, regular client feedback, and extensive user testing, including two dedicated “test-a-thon” events.

The final product demonstrates how open-source mapping, translation, and AI tools can be combined into a scalable and flexible solution. Looking ahead, there is strong potential for future improvements such as expanding language support, integrating premium translation APIs, and enhancing the cultural information.
