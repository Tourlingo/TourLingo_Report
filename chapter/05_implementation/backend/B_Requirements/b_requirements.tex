\subsection{Requirements Engineering and Design Constraints}

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements Derivation}

The backend requirements emerged from three primary sources: user experience expectations
for tourism applications, technical constraints of mobile frontend integration, and operational
requirements for maintainable software systems.

\subsubsection{FR1: Real-time Translation Service}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Requirement:} Process English text input and return translations in target languages with 
    sub-second response times.
    \item \textbf{Criticality:} High - Core application functionality enabling multilingual user experience.
    \item \textbf{Complexity:} Medium - Requires external service integration, data format handling, and
parallel processing capabilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{FR2: Multi-language Support}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Requirement:} Support minimum three languages initially (Spanish, French, German) with
architectural extensibility for additional languages.
    \item \textbf{Design Impact:} Influenced service architecture to enable horizontal scaling and languageagnostic processing.
    \item \textbf{Future Scalability:} Architecture must accommodate language additions without service
redesign or performance degradation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{FR3: Concurrent Request Handling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Requirement:} Process multiple simultaneous translation requests from different users without
performance degradation.
\item \textbf{Technical Specification:} Support minimum 50 concurrent users with linear performance
scaling.
\item \textbf{Implementation Challenge:} Required careful consideration of threading models and resource
allocation strategies.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{FR4: API-Based Communication}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Requirement:} Expose RESTful endpoints with JSON format for seamless frontend integration.
    \item \textbf{Standards Compliance:} Adherence to REST architectural principles and HTTP status code
conventions.
    \item \textbf{Data Format:} Structured JSON request/response format maintaining semantic relationships.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements Prioritization}

Using the MoSCoW prioritization method, requirements were classified as follows:

\subsubsection{Must Have Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A Sub-second response time for translation requests under normal load conditions.
    \item Concurrent user support with graceful performance degradation.
    \item System availability of 99.5\% during operational hours.
    \item Data security and input validation to prevent injection attacks.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Should Have Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Horizontal scalability to accommodate traffic increases.
    \item Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities.
    \item Modular architecture enabling independent service updates.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Could Have Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Advanced caching strategies for frequently translated content.
    \item Real-time performance monitoring dashboards.
    \item Automated deployment and rollback capabilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Won't Have Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Offline translation capabilities.
    \item Machine learning-based translation quality improvement.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Constraint Analysis}

\subsubsection{Budgetary Constraints:}
The project operated under strict cost limitations, requiring zero recurring API subscription
costs. This constraint significantly influenced technology selection, eliminating commercial
translation services despite their superior quality metrics.

\subsubsection{Technical Constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Containerized deployment requirement for cloud and on-premises environments.
    \item Integration compatibility with React-based frontend architecture.
    \item Resource limitations of target deployment infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Operational Constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Self-hosting capability requirement for data privacy and cost control.
    \item Maintenance burden acceptable within team capacity.
    \item Scalability requirements without proportional infrastructure cost increases.
\end{itemize}
